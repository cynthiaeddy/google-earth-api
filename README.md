# Earth Paints
Earth Paints is an app to discover images that Google Earth has taken. It amazes me that the earth from afar resembles what artists emotionally strive to emulate. Incorporates a search bar where users can search by Country with the caveat they aren't all represented.

This App has two Github Repositories. This one is for the Rails API backend. The other one is for the React frontend (link below in instructions).

## Instructions
To run this app:

PART ONE

Clone this repo, then run 'bundle install'.

Run rails db:create, rails db:migrate and rails db:seed to seed the database.

After the database is set up, run 'rails s' in terminal to start the rails server.

PART TWO

Go to https://github.com/cynthiaeddy/google-earth-client and follow the instructions to run the Earth Paints frontend.
